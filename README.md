## About The Project

This project is a simple website built with [Astro][Astro-url] and hosted with [Netlify][Netlify-url] at https://csvlewis.com to display a short "About Me" page with links to my other online profiles and contact information.

<img src="src/assets/screenshot.png" width="725" height="500">

The static website is comprised of mostly text, pictures, and links. I purchased and configured the https://csvlewis.com web domain using [Porkbun][Porkbun-url]. I configured email hosting/forwarding with Porkbun to enable a personal email address at chris@csvlewis.com.

I also added a route at https://csvlewis.com/resume where you can view and download my current resume. Simply visit the URL to see the PDF file displayed in the browser.
